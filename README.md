# Poli

Poli is a platform that allows an organization whose work takes place at different locations to establish the capacities to execute different types of tasks in parallel (*or not*) at user-defined time intervals, within a specific calendar. The model under which tasks and locations are created and configured is based exclusively on the user or organization experience.

Once types of tasks and schedules are defined for locations, the application exposes a web interface for consumer users for consulting the availability of execution of a type of task, subsequently allowing to book an appointment at a location to be carried out on the scheduled calendar. Consumers can see and cancel bookings afterwards, in a specific schedule page.

Corporate users are provided with a dedicated web application where they can see administered location schedules on a daily basis with an occupancy report. Also they can configure location availabilities in ways it is easy to repear certain configuration daily or weekly. Available tasks, locations, and supervised locations are configured via a system superuser in the django admin interface.

## Why I did it
Years ago I was working at a company that installed tracking devices in vehicles. Vehicle types could be bikes, cars, trucks, trailers, boats. Installations and services were done in shops across the country, and managing service schedules was a tough. While when I was working there we developed a custom made software solution for solving these problems, it was tightly coupled with the company's bussiness domain, and I always thought that if a platform existed that could provide the solution, it would have been somewhat cost effective. This is why I chose to create Poli, to solve these kind of problems I faced in the past.

## Features
### Consumer User (*Policon*)
#### Search for Openings
- Any user, logged in or not, can search for openings for a certain task and date. If no date is entered in the search criteria, the first date with the selected task will be returned.
- Only today's or future dates are valid.
- If a logged out user clicks the *Book* button after making a search, she will be redirected to the login page.
- For each opening, date and time are presented to the user, and a location icon link to a Google Maps browser tab querying that location. Task duration is also presented to the user.

#### Book an Opening
- Logged in users can book an opening from the search page, and after clicking the *Book* button, a confirmation message is presented.
- After booking an opening, the user is redirected to the *My Schedule* page.

#### My Schedule
- Logged in users can see a list of bookings made by them, ordered ascending by date and time.
- Logged in users can download a calendar iCal file for each booking, clicking on a calendar icon link. This file can then be imported to Google Calendar.
- For each booking, date and time are presented to the user, and a location icon link to a Google Maps browser tab querying that location.

#### Cancel a Booking
- Logged in users can cancel a booking at any time from the *My Schedule* page, clicking on the *Cancel* button of the booking.

### Corporate user (*Policorp*)
#### Location Schedule
- Logged in users can select a locations, which they supervise, and a date, to see a daily occupancy report and schedule.
- An occupancy report is shown for a date, indicating how many bookings have been made and how many availabilities are still free.
- A schedule is presented in ascending order by date and time, including both bookings and availabilites together.
- A schedule can be filtered, and a user can select to see a full schedule, a bookings schedule or an availabilities schedule for a given location and date.

#### Location Configuration
- A logged in location supervisor user can add a single availability for a given location, task, date and time, at the *Location Configuration* page.
- A single availability configuration can be extended on the same date repeatedly in a given time frame. For example, if a task has a duration of 1 hour and starts at 8am, and she sets an extended configuration until 14pm, then 6 contiguous availabilities for that task will be generated for the selected date.
- A single or extended availability configuration can be repeated on selected weekdays during a period of time. A user can select which weekdays she wished to repeat a configuration and a finish date, so a configuration generated on a daily repetition basis.

#### Admin Console
- Tasks and Locations can be created at the admin console by a logged in superuser.
- Locations have users assigned that supervise them, so they can see and configure schedules.

## Project Structure
The project has two Django applications that rely to work on only one set of models, and one user administration.

The main application is Policorp, intended to be used by corporate users. It has all the models and provides an interface for integrating with them throughout the process.

Policon is an application that integrates with Policorp and provides consumer users ways to interact with corporate services.

## User Roles Model
There are three user roles available:
- Consumer: These users can access Policon app to book, see their own schedule, or cancel bookings. Anyone can register as a consumer.
- Corporate Location Supervisor: These users manage locations schedules. They can create availabilities on a location schedule, and see a report of occupancy on a daily basis.
- Corporate Superuser: This is the basic Django provided superuser. Superusers create available tasks and locations, create corporate supervisor users, and assign them to certain locations, via the standard admin console.

## External Javascript libraries
Several external Javascript libraries are used for UI design:
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Popper](https://popper.js.org/docs/v1/)
- [Gijgo](https://gijgo.com/)
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

## Code test coverge
Python code in this project was built using a TDD approach, providing tests at different levels (*models, views, clients*). Code covergate is of more than 90%, with more than 120 tests, generating a set of tests sufficient enough to minimize regression errors while evolving the application.

## CI/CD
A push on the master branch triggers a github action, which runs all tests, and sets a threshold of code test coverage to 90%, failing if it results under that limit value. A code coverage report is then generated and published to GitHub Pages.

Latest code coverage report can be seen [here](https://eldocbrown.github.io/poli/)
